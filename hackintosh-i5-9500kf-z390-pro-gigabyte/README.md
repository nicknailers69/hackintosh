## UPDATES: I decided to add my config.plist in case some people may need it. I did replace information in the smbios section. Put your own! :)

# Guarantees
## I do not guarantee this will work on your machine. Make sure to back it up. I am not responsible if you break anything. Always follow the official guides first. This is intended to help you figure out what kext and drivers you may need for your build if something doesn't work.
